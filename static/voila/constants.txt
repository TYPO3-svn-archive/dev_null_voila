Try different settings if dates and times are not shown correctly. On Windows-servers use the literals e.g. "german", on Linux-servers try to use the codes (e.g. de_DE*) according to the language you use. To find out which locales are installed on your Linux-Server, type 'locale -a' in a shell. Possible values are e.g. german, english (for Windows) or de_DE, de_DE@euro, de_DE.iso88591, de_DE.iso885915@euro, de_DE.utf8, en_US, en_US.iso88591, en_US.iso885915, en_US.utf8 (for Linux).
